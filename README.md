# BipolarDisorder
These repository contains the scripts for the reproducibility of analyses and plots

R scripts include the packages that required for analyses.
Plotting scripts does not plot the exact version of the plots in the article. Some modifications were made manually.
All required inputs are also stored in R folder.
CEL files were manually from NCBI GEO GSE5388 page. 

Cytoscape network has been drawn manually.

Matlab scripts required Gurobi as solver and CobraToolbox for analyses.

Text files in matlab folder are the generated networks of iMS571 brain-specific genome-scale model. Expression data also saved as .m file.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

Due to sampling step produces 10000 flux distributions from solution space and randomly selects 1000 of them, results may vary in reproduction.
